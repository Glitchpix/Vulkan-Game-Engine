## C++ Game/Rendering engine using Vulkan

This is a personal project started for fun to learn how to structure and design a rendering/game engine primarily based on the low-level Vulkan graphics API (https://www.vulkan.org/).

Much of the structure and design is heavily lifted from the Kohi game engine (https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi) by Travis Vroman, with my own translation from C to C++, including many changes from the orginal design.
